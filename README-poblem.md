# issue redirect poblem always with status 500

I have seen some content that says even flask messages are stored on the server directly,
so since I am using jwt, then this should be useless, and is this the cause for the redirect as well?

I used , jwt , and mysql

route

```bash
 admin/signIn
 admin/signUp
 admin/
 user/signIn
 user/signUp
 user/
 product/


```

Thank you for reading my issue
and Sorry, looks like I was the one who made a mistake.
